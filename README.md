# Sign-Language-Detection🤖🧏‍♂️
📌 Project Overview
This project uses computer vision and machine learning to detect and interpret sign language gestures in real-time using a webcam. It aims to bridge the communication gap between the deaf and others by translating sign language into text or sentences. 
In this project there are many different codes one for collecting the data using one hand, collecting the data using two hands, and the final for testing the working of project i.e to run the project.
In this project I have used Teachable Machine platform form for training the datasets and converting them into the models.
The main aim of the project is to bridge the communication between the deaf and normal people.
I have used American Sign language for my project.
Many different python libraries are used.
